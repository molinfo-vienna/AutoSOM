1)  Implemented exception for glutathione. Concerns 328 reactions in the MetaQSAR dataset.
    This case is now taken care of right at the beginning of the pipeline as a separate category.
        TODO:   There are a few cases of class 104 where the glutathione "replaces" a halogen. 
                The labels are inconsistent. The annotator sometimes fails to find the ground truth.
                I need to find a plausible reaction mechanism for this biotransformation to settle the case.

2)  Moved the molecular weight filter to the critical part of the algorithm (MCS matching and simple redox reactions),
    so that other parts of the algorithm which are not too affected by the size of the molecules can run without rejection.
    For MetaQSAR and a maximum number of heavy atoms set at 30, this reduced the mumber of rejections from 777 to 120,
    whithout increasing the runtime by a significant amount.

3)  Implemented reaction halogen -> hydroxy group as a separate reaction type. Previously, it was handled during MCS matching.

4)  Removed the maximum molecular wieght and minimum number of heavy atoms filters.
    It does not affect more than 100 reactions, and I think this is the fairer way to eavluate the model.

5)  In general, I'm working on refactoring the code to make it as clear and maintanable as possible.
    This includes splitting large functions into more manageable subfunctions and adding documentation.
    I've also started to use the recommended CI-CD pipeline.

6)  Verbosity: added the annotation rule to the output (see property in the substrates.sdf output file) for easier tracking.
    This info could already be found in the log file, but this is even easier.

7)  Concerning the ester hydrolysis: until now, dealkylation reactions and ester hydrolysis were being taken care of 
    separately and resulted in different annoation strategies. This is consistent with the MetaQSAR data set.
    However, BASF has requested that this distinction should not be made because it is confusing for many chemists.
    I have adde a command-line option to deactivate the special ester hydrolysis annotation.
    Per default, SOMAN annotates ester hydrolyses with the same logic as dealkylation reactions.
    If the -e argument is set, the annotation of ester hydrolyses is consistent with MetaQSAR.


TODO (after discussion on 11.10.24)

1) Email: Clarify multi-steps reactions; SOMAN will never be able to handle those, because it is impossible to do structure matching on "unknown" intermediates.
2) Email: Ask again for examples about the piperazine ring opening. On the examples I have the tool works fine, but it might fail on assymetrical piperazines.

3)  The rule for molecule containing phosphorus atoms is too simple; improve it.
4)  Currently I annotate both C and O for redox reactions at ketones/alcohols. This is consistent with MetaQSAR. but BASF argues that it is confusing. Find a solution.
5)  Morpholine: look at it again; BASF found an example where the pipeline completely fails. For now, I simply removed it.
6)  Look at ring closure reactions. These are actually very tricky and need to be taken care of as "complex".

Current state:
    number of annotated reactions: 5780
    number of annotated substrates (multiple reactions per substrate): 2722
    number of reactions where the pipeline runs to the end without finding any SoMs (i.e. "fails"): 6
    percentage of full match: 0.83
    perecentage of partial match: 0.94
    number of reactions filtered out due to being too large (>40 heavy atoms): 119
    percentage of full match, excluding the reactions where the maximum number of heavy atoms filter was applied: 0.85
    perecentage of partial match, excluding the reactions where the maximum number of heavy atoms filter was applied: 0.96
    runtime: ca. 35min for filter at 40; ca. 5min for filter at 30
