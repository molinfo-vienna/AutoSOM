1)  Implemented exception for glutathione. Concerns 129 reactions in the MetaQSAR dataset.
    This case is now taken care of right at the beginning of the pipeline as a separate category.
        TODO:   There are a few cases of class 104 where the glutathione "replaces" and halogen. 
                The labels are inconsistent. The annotator sometimes fails to find the ground truth.
                I need to find a plausible reaction mechanism for this biotransformation to settle the case.

2)  Moved the molecular weight filter to the critical part of the algorithm (MCS matching and simple redox reactions),
    so that other parts of the algorithm which are not too affected by the size of the molecules can run without rejection.
    For MetaQSAR and a maximum number of heavy atoms set at 30, this reduced the mumber of rejections from 777 to 394,
    whithout increasing the runtime by a significant amount.

3) Implemented reaction halogen -> hydroxy group as a separate reaction type. Previously, it was handled during MCS matching.


TODO (after discussion on 11.10.24)

1)  Ester hydrolysis/dealkylation inconsistent
2)  Currently I annotate both C and O for redox reactions at ketones/alcohols. This is consistent with MetaQSAR. but BASF argues that it is confusing. Find a solution.
3)  Piperazine: annotate only one side
4)  Morpholine: look at it again; BASF found an example where the pipeline completely fails
5)  The rule for molecule containing phosphorus atoms is too simple; improve it.
6)  Try and make the output more verbose (log file is not enough)
7)  Clarify multi-steps reactions; it will probably never be possible to handle those.
8)  Look at ring closure reactions. These are actually very tricky and need to be taken care of as "complex".

Current state:
    number of annotated reactions: 5048
    percentage of full match: 0.85
    perecentage of partial match: 0.93
